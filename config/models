-- | We keep email a separate entity because we don't necessarily want to
-- require users to give us their emails, which would typically mean that we
-- would make the field nullable. But we also want to enforce that emails be
-- unique, and nullable fields cannot have Uniqueness constraints in Persistent,
-- so we instead store emails in a separate entity.
--
-- One other benefit to keep Email a separate entity is if deciding to have an
-- email-based authentication mechanism, which would require additional fields
-- to keep track of email verification.
