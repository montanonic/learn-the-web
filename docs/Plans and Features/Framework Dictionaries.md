# Framework Dictionary

A separate part of the website will contain dictionaries for each web framework.
These dictionaries will give specific information on how to use the framework
down to the level of the function, such that even a specific function might have
pages of explanations that show all the different ways someone could use it.

The Framework Dictionary will be in-depth by its very nature. See `Framework
Concepts` for a more breadthful overview of a Framework's features and general
paradigms.
