# Framework Concepts

Where `Framework Dictionaries` provides a focused explanation of a framework
down to the level of a function or a class, `Concepts` tackles paradigms about
using the framework itself. The Yesod Book, for example, would largely fall
under the `Concepts` section, as it explains how to use the framework in
general, and why it was implemented in particular ways.

Concepts will consist of Chapters and Sections just like the Guide to the Web,
however there will be no need for Padding, as the information contained here
will be framework-specific anyways.
