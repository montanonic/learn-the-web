# The Guide to the Web

This will be the core of the website, as it will be the place where all
frameworks can collaborate together to focus on explanations about how to use
the web, guiding a user from the most basic ideas on up.

The Guide to the Web will consist of `Chapters, Sections, and Padding`. See the
markdown document for more information.

## What should Chapters be like?

One question we face is whether or not our Guide to the Web should be a
sequential read, like a wikibook, or if it should be a collection of topics,
each self-contained (like HTTP, JSON, AJAX, Notifications, et cetera).
Currently, I find the topics model to be far more extensible.
