# Chapters, Sections, and Padding

## Overview

Chapters outline a general area of focus within a larger space (this space being
Web Development). Chapters will have sections nested within them, each section
more narrowly focusing on a specific idea within the topic of the chapter.

So for example, there could be a chapter on HTML on the web, which might have
opening sections explaining the gist of HTML (with links to more in depth
topics), a section on HTML forms, and a section on dynamically generating HTML.

Now each of these sections would be open for edit by the community, wiki-style.
While this alone can be helpful, wiki-style editing doesn't really offer
anything new, which is why I'm introducing the idea of Padding:

Each section will also have the opportunity of having framework/library-specific
content added before and after it, where users can select their preferred
framework (and swap them out at will), and will see content specific to that
framework padded around each section. This content will help to inform users
about actually implementing some of these things, such as Yesod's templates for
dynamic HTML generation section, and can link users to more elaborate
explanations in that frameworks `Dictionary` or `Concepts`.
