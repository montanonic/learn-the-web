Stack Overflow is a great website for the Q/A style format. It will probably be
worthwhile to integrate with it wherever appropriate.

## In-house questions

The website should have a questions tab for people seeking specific answers to
topics, but instead of having an in-house Q/A system, what we should do is make
it so that we redirect to Stack Overflow, and have a system for querying Stack
Overflow for questions related to web development.

## Reputation/Moderation privileges from SO

If there's a way to authenticate someone as a Stack Overflow user, we should
grant them a certain amount of reputation to gain access to privileges on this
site, as they would clearly be vetted users.
