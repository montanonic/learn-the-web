# Core Features

This document will describe the basic features that will flesh out a skeleton
for this website. Further elaboration for each feature can be found in more
specific markdown documents within this directory, should they exist.

## The Features This Website Needs:

* Account creation should be quick and simple. It should not require a password,
or any personally identifying information aside from a user's unique identifier.

* A reputation system and moderation system, with the goal of encouraging user
participation, while also creating self-governance and content-curation, to
fight back against any website abuse and result in higher quality content.

* A series on topics in web development that starts with the basics and leads up
to more advanced topics. This will be user-contributed, and there will no
set-in-stone progression. Rather, each topic will be community edited to suggest
which topics should precede the current one (as in, its helpful to know them
first), and which topics would sensibly follow it. This allows users to guide
their own progression as they see fit. See `The Guide to the Web`

* A Concepts page for each web framework, consisting of chapters on 
framework-specific paradigms. 75% of the Yesod Book would fall under this
category (I think), with the rest of it being part of the Dictionary mentioned
below.

* A Dictionary page for very specific explanations of each and every thing
within a framework. Mostly, this will cover individual functions, or groups
of functions within the framework.

* ELI5 (Explain it Like I'm 5, a subreddit) guidelines when posting. Content
should be simple and to the point, and avoid elaborate language. This does not
mean content needs to be brief, it just means that simplicity is the goal to
strive for, and any edits which change nothing about a post except to make it
simpler to read, or a bit more clear, are welcomed.
